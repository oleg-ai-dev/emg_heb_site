*   **Blog Post Updates:** Added a call-to-action banner mid-content to all three blog posts (`guillain-barre-syndrome`, `carpal-tunnel-syndrome`, `תסמונות-לחץ-עצבים`) as requested.
*   **Contact Form Submission:** Implemented webhook submission logic in `ContactForm.tsx` using `fetch` API to send data to the specified Make.com URL. Added success/error handling and toast notifications.

## 3. Next Steps
1.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the blog styling improvements, added banners, contact form submission logic, and new footer layout.
2.  Present the completed task to the user using `attempt_completion`.
3.  Await further instructions from the user.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Footer Refactoring:** Completed. Addressed the previous duplication issue.
*   **Footer Color Scheme:** Updated footer background from `bg-gray-900` to `bg-medblue-dark` to align with header and project palette.
*   **Placeholder Links:** The footer still contains placeholder links (`#`) for "מדיניות פרטיות" and "צור קשר". These will need actual pages or valid links eventually.
