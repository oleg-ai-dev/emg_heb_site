# Product Context: MEDASSIST EMG Website

## 1. Problem Space
*   **Information Gap:** Individuals needing EMG tests often face uncertainty. They may lack clear, accessible information in Hebrew about what the test involves, why it's needed, what conditions it helps diagnose (like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Guillain-Barr√©, nerve compression), and what to expect.
*   **Finding Specialized Care:** Locating a dedicated clinic that specializes specifically in EMG testing, uses modern equipment, and employs experienced neurologists can be difficult amidst general healthcare options.
*   **Anxiety & Urgency:** Patients often seek EMG tests due to concerning symptoms (pain, numbness, weakness). They need a quick, reassuring, and efficient way to find information and schedule an appointment.
*   **Trust & Credibility:** Choosing a medical provider requires trust. Potential patients need assurance of the clinic's expertise, professionalism, and positive patient outcomes.

## 2. Proposed Solution
The MEDASSIST EMG website (`emg_heb_site`) addresses these problems by serving as:
*   **An Educational Hub:** Providing clear explanations of EMG tests, related conditions, and the clinic's process in Hebrew.
*   **A Specialized Clinic Showcase:** Highlighting MEDASSIST's focus on EMG, its experienced medical team, advanced technology, and patient-centric approach.
*   **A Lead Generation Tool:** Making it simple for users to contact the clinic via phone or an online form to inquire or book appointments quickly.
*   **A Trust-Building Platform:** Featuring testimonials, details about the specialists, and professional content (blog) to build credibility.

## 3. User Experience Goals
The website aims to provide the following experience:
*   **Informative & Reassuring:** Users should easily find comprehensive information about EMG testing and related conditions, feeling confident and less anxious about the process and MEDASSIST's capabilities.
*   **Efficient & Action-Oriented:** Users seeking appointments should find contact information (phone number, form) immediately accessible and easy to use, facilitating quick scheduling.
*   **Professional & Trustworthy:** The design, language, and content must convey medical expertise, reliability, and a focus on patient well-being.
*   **Accessible & Clear:** Navigation should be intuitive, and content should be well-organized and written in clear, understandable Hebrew, catering to a non-medical audience.
*   **Seamless Across Devices:** The site must be fully responsive and provide an optimal experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   **Supportive:** The overall tone should be supportive and empathetic to users who may be dealing with uncomfortable or worrying symptoms.
