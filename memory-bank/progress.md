# Progress: MEDASSIST EMG Website (Initialization)

## 1. What Works / Completed Features
*   **Core Site Structure:** React SPA setup with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Routing:** Basic client-side routing implemented (`/`, `/blog`, `/blog/:id`).
*   **Main Landing Page (`/`):**
    *   Displays clinic information, benefits, process, testimonials, FAQs, contact form.
    *   Includes header, footer, responsive design, RTL support.
    *   Features interactive elements (scroll effects, mobile menu).
*   **Blog Section (`/blog`, `/blog/:id`):**
    *   Displays a list of blog posts with excerpts and images (`Blog.tsx`). Styling improved (header alignment, card padding, metadata grouping, link alignment).
    *   Displays individual blog posts with full content (`BlogPost.tsx`). Styling improved (metadata grouping, paragraph leading).
    *   Includes SEO optimizations (`react-helmet`).
    *   Content is currently hardcoded within components.
*   **UI Components:** Base UI components (`shadcn/ui`) and custom application components (`src/components`) are functional.
*   **Accessibility Statement Page (`/הצהרת-נגישות`):**
    *   Page component created (`src/pages/AccessibilityStatement.tsx`).
    *   Route added (`src/App.tsx`).
    *   Link added to footers (`Index.tsx`, `Blog.tsx`, `BlogPost.tsx`).
    *   Styling refined using specific Tailwind classes for improved readability.
    *   Image banner implemented using single composite image (`/images/הצהרת נגישות.jpg`) via `write_to_file` after `replace_in_file` issues.
*   **About Us Page (`/about-us`):**
    *   Page component created (`src/pages/AboutUs.tsx`).
    *   Image banner added using `/images/about-us-banner.jpg`.
    *   Redundant image removed from main content area.
    *   Route added (`src/App.tsx`).
*   **Terms & Conditions Page (`/terms-conditions`):**
    *   Page component created (`src/pages/TermsConditions.tsx`).
    *   Route added (`src/App.tsx`).
*   **Footer:**
    *   Refactored into reusable `src/components/Footer.tsx` component.
    *   Updated layout to display links vertically.
    *   Adjusted text alignment to `text-right` for RTL.
    *   Updated links (Accessibility, About Us, Terms).
    *   Replaced duplicated footer code in all page components with `<Footer />`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / In Progress
*   **Contact Form Submission:** Backend logic/integration for the contact form is assumed but not confirmed (requires checking `ContactForm.tsx` and potential backend/API).
*   **Blog Content Management:** Currently hardcoded. Future enhancement might involve a CMS or API integration for easier content updates.
*   **Footer Links:** Placeholder links for "מדיניות פרטיות" and "צור קשר" still point to `#`. These need actual pages or updated links.
*   **Testing:** No automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) are apparent in the file structure.

## 3. Current Status
*   **Memory Bank:** Initial setup completed. Core files created and updated.
*   **Accessibility Page:** Created, styled, and banner implemented.
*   **About Us Page:** Created, banner added, content refined.
*   **Terms & Conditions Page:** Created.
*   **Footer:** Refactored, layout updated, and alignment fixed.
*   **Blog Pages:** Styling and readability improved. Task completed.
*   **Overall:** The website is functional with the new pages and updated footer/blog styling. Awaiting next task.

## 4. Known Issues / Potential Improvements
*   **Footer Duplication:** Resolved by refactoring into `Footer.tsx`.
*   **Placeholder Footer Links:** Links for "מדיניות פרטיות" and "צור קשר" are placeholders (`#`).
*   **Contact Form Backend:** Functionality needs verification.
*   **Blog Content Source:** Content is hardcoded.
*   **Testing:** Lack of automated tests.
