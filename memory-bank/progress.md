# Progress: MEDASSIST EMG Website (Initialization)

## 1. What Works / Completed Features
*   **Core Site Structure:** React SPA setup with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Performance:** Implemented code-splitting for page components (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`) in `src/App.tsx` to improve initial load times and address build warnings.
    *   **Performance (Fonts):** Optimized Google Fonts loading by removing render-blocking `@import` from `src/index.css` and adding asynchronous `<link>` tags to `index.html`.
    *   **Performance (JS):** Added `defer` attribute to the `gptengineer.js` script tag in `index.html` to potentially improve loading performance.
*   **Routing:** Basic client-side routing implemented (`/`, `/blog`, `/blog/:id`).
*   **Main Landing Page (`/`):**
    *   Displays clinic information, benefits, process, testimonials, FAQs, contact form.
    *   Includes header, footer, responsive design, RTL support.
    *   Features interactive elements (scroll effects, mobile menu).
*   **Blog Section (`/blog`, `/blog/:id`):**
    *   Displays a list of blog posts with excerpts and images (`Blog.tsx`). Styling improved. Header subtitle updated for better description. Added new posts: "Inflammatory Myopathies" (`inflammatory-myopathies`), "Muscular Dystrophy" (`muscular-dystrophy`), "Myasthenia Gravis" (`myasthenia-gravis`), "ALS" (`als`), "Polio/Post-Polio" (`polio-post-polio`), "Radiculopathy" (`radiculopathy`).
    *   Displays individual blog posts (`BlogPost.tsx`). Styling improved. Added reusable CTA banner (~1/3 point) and short contact form (~2/3 point) components (`BlogCtaBanner`, `BlogShortForm`) within all longer article content files (`src/articles/content/*`). Added short contact form to `what-is-emg.tsx`. Layout adjusted in `als`, `polio-post-polio`, `radiculopathy` articles. Added new posts.
    *   **Performance:** Implemented dynamic content loading using `React.lazy` for post content (JSX stored in `src/articles/content/`). Metadata remains in `BlogPost.tsx`.
    *   Includes SEO optimizations (`react-helmet`).
    *   Blog index (`Blog.tsx`) still references hardcoded data (needs update if metadata source changes).
*   **UI Components:** Base UI components (`shadcn/ui`) and custom application components (`src/components`, including `BlogCtaBanner`, `BlogShortForm`) are functional.
*   **Accessibility Statement Page (`/הצהרת-נגישות`):**
    *   Page component created (`src/pages/AccessibilityStatement.tsx`).
    *   Route added (`src/App.tsx`).
    *   Link added to footers (`Index.tsx`, `Blog.tsx`, `BlogPost.tsx`).
    *   Styling refined using specific Tailwind classes for improved readability.
    *   Image banner implemented using single composite image (`/images/הצהרת נגישות.jpg`) via `write_to_file` after `replace_in_file` issues.
*   **About Us Page (`/about-us`):**
    *   Page component created (`src/pages/AboutUs.tsx`).
    *   Image banner added using `/images/about-us-banner.jpg`.
    *   Redundant image removed from main content area.
    *   Route added (`src/App.tsx`).
*   **Terms & Conditions Page (`/terms-conditions`):**
    *   Page component created (`src/pages/TermsConditions.tsx`).
    *   Route added (`src/App.tsx`).
*   **Footer:**
    *   Refactored into reusable `src/components/Footer.tsx` component.
    *   Updated layout to remove logo section and center links/copyright text as per user image.
    *   Updated links (Accessibility, About Us, Terms).
    *   Replaced duplicated footer code in all page components with `<Footer />`.
    *   Updated background color from `bg-gray-900` to `bg-medblue-dark` for consistency with header and project palette.
*   **SEO Analysis:** Completed analysis of site structure, technical files, content, and image usage against current best practices.
*   **SEO Implementation (Phase 1):**
    *   Added meta tags (`react-helmet`) to core pages (`Index.tsx`, `AboutUs.tsx`, `AccessibilityStatement.tsx`, `TermsConditions.tsx`). `Blog.tsx` already had them.
    *   Added structured data (`FAQPage`, `MedicalClinic`) to `Index.tsx`.
    *   Added internal links from relevant blog posts to the "What is EMG?" article.
    *   Optimized image alt text on `Index.tsx`.
    *   Updated homepage `<title>` tag (`src/pages/Index.tsx`) to be more descriptive.
*   **Header:** Added icons to desktop navigation links.
*   **Analytics:** Added Umami tracking script to `index.html`.
*   **Google Site Verification:** Added Google site verification meta tag to `index.html`.
*   **Bing Site Verification:** Added Bing site verification meta tag (`msvalidate.01`) to `index.html`.
*   **Image Update:** Replaced external image with local one in `AboutUs.tsx`.
*   **Contact Form Source Field:** Modified `ContactForm.tsx` and `BlogShortForm.tsx` to add/update the `source: "emg"` field in the JSON payload sent to the webhook upon form submission.

## 2. What's Left to Build / In Progress
*   **SEO Implementation (Potential Phase 2):**
    *   Further review and optimization of keyword integration within page body content.
    *   Add `og:image` tags where missing/appropriate.
    *   Add more diverse internal links between related blog posts/pages.
*   **Blog Content Management:** Currently hardcoded. Future enhancement might involve a CMS or API integration for easier content updates.
*   **Footer Links:** Placeholder links for "מדיניות פרטיות" and "צור קשר" still point to `#`. These need actual pages or updated links.
*   **Testing:** No automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) are apparent in the file structure.

## 3. Current Status
*   **Memory Bank:** Initial setup completed. Core files created and updated. `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updated for contact form source field task.
*   **Accessibility Page:** Created, styled, and banner implemented.
*   **About Us Page:** Created, banner added, content refined.
*   **Terms & Conditions Page:** Created.

*   **Contact Form:** Submission logic implemented via webhook. Added `source: "emg"` field to payload for both main and blog short forms. Task completed.
*   **Performance:** Code-splitting implemented for page routes and blog post content. Font loading optimized. `gptengineer.js` script deferred. Task completed.
*   **SEO:** Analysis complete. Initial implementation phase (meta tags, structured data, basic internal linking, alt text, homepage title update) completed.
*   **Header:** Icons added to desktop navigation. Task completed.
*   **Analytics:** Umami script added. Task completed.
*   **Image:** Path updated in About Us. Task completed.
*   **Google Site Verification:** Tag added to `index.html`. Task completed.
*   **Bing Site Verification:** Tag added to `index.html`. Task completed.
*   **Overall:** The website is functional with the new pages, updated footer layout, improved blog styling/CTAs/layout, working contact form submission, enhanced code-splitting, optimized font loading, deferred `gptengineer.js` script, initial SEO improvements (including homepage title update), header icons, analytics script, Google site verification tag, and Bing site verification tag. Blog CTAs implemented across all articles as requested.

## 4. Known Issues / Potential Improvements
*   **Performance - Unused JS (Main Bundle):** The main JS bundle (`/assets/index-*.js`) still reports unused code. Further optimization might require dependency analysis or more complex refactoring beyond existing code splitting.
*   **Performance - CSS:** The main CSS file (`/assets/index-*.css`) is still identified as potentially render-blocking. Further optimization (e.g., inlining critical CSS) could be explored if needed, but this is more complex.
*   **SEO - Keyword Integration:** Body content keyword density/placement could be further reviewed.
*   **SEO - Internal Linking:** Could add more links between related blog topics beyond just linking to "What is EMG?".
*   **SEO - OG Images:** Some pages lack specific `og:image` tags.
*   **Footer Duplication:** Resolved.
*   **Footer Color Scheme:** Resolved.
*   **Footer Layout:** Updated to match user image.
*   **Placeholder Footer Links:** Links for "מדיניות פרטיות" and "צור קשר" are placeholders (`#`).
*   **Contact Form Backend:** Submission implemented via Make.com webhook. (No dedicated backend API).
*   **Blog Content Source:** Content is now split (metadata in `BlogPost.tsx`, JSX in `src/articles/content/`). `Blog.tsx` still uses hardcoded data for the index page. Future enhancement could involve a unified data source.
*   **Testing:** Lack of automated tests.
*   **Build Warning:** Code-splitting implemented for pages and blog content to address chunk size warnings; verification via `npm run build` is needed.
