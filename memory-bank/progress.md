# Progress: MEDASSIST EMG Website

## 1. What Works / Completed Features
- All articles and blog content have been refactored to use a visually appealing, highly readable format:
  - <article> with Tailwind prose classes for optimal typography
  - Headings, lists, and blockquotes styled for clarity and accessibility
  - Internal CTAs (BlogCtaBanner, BlogShortForm) spaced and visually distinct
  - No duplicate images (featured image only in blog template, not in article body)
  - No redundant CTAs at the end of articles (only the buffer CTA is used)
  - All articles are at least 1300 words, SEO-optimized, and use long-tail keyword research
  - Images are sourced from Unsplash or similar, downloaded and stored locally
  - Sitemap.xml is generated and includes all main pages and blog articles
- Editorial and technical directives for all future articles are now codified in the Memory Bank and .clinerules.
- All static pages (About Us, Accessibility, Terms, etc.) are included in the sitemap.
- All blog articles are discoverable and indexed for search engines.

## 2. What's Left to Build / In Progress
- For every new article:
  - Strictly follow the editorial, SEO, and formatting standards as documented in the Memory Bank and .clinerules.
  - Use Brave and Fetch for long-tail keyword research.
  - Use only a single featured image (no duplicates in article body).
  - Use only the buffer CTA at the end of articles.
  - Update sitemap.xml with every new article or page.

## 3. Current Status
- The site is fully up to date with the latest editorial, SEO, and formatting standards.
- All articles and static pages are included in the sitemap.
- The Memory Bank and .clinerules are the source of truth for all future content and editorial work.

## 4. Known Issues / Potential Improvements
- Continue to monitor for any new editorial or SEO best practices and update the Memory Bank and .clinerules as needed.
- Consider automating sitemap.xml updates as part of the article publishing workflow.
- Continue to review and improve accessibility and mobile readability as new content is added.
