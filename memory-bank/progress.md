# Progress: MEDASSIST EMG Website (Initialization)

## 1. What Works / Completed Features
*   **Core Site Structure:** React SPA setup with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Performance:** Implemented code-splitting for page components (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`) in `src/App.tsx` to improve initial load times and address build warnings.
*   **Routing:** Basic client-side routing implemented (`/`, `/blog`, `/blog/:id`).
*   **Main Landing Page (`/`):**
    *   Displays clinic information, benefits, process, testimonials, FAQs, contact form.
    *   Includes header, footer, responsive design, RTL support.
    *   Features interactive elements (scroll effects, mobile menu).
*   **Blog Section (`/blog`, `/blog/:id`):**
    *   Displays a list of blog posts with excerpts and images (`Blog.tsx`). Styling improved (header alignment, card padding, metadata grouping, link alignment). Added new posts: "Inflammatory Myopathies" (`inflammatory-myopathies`), "Muscular Dystrophy" (`muscular-dystrophy`), "Myasthenia Gravis" (`myasthenia-gravis`), "ALS" (`als`), "Polio/Post-Polio" (`polio-post-polio`), "Radiculopathy" (`radiculopathy`).
    *   Displays individual blog posts with full content (`BlogPost.tsx`). Styling improved (metadata grouping, paragraph leading). Added a mid-content call-to-action banner to all posts. Added new posts: "Inflammatory Myopathies" (`inflammatory-myopathies`), "Muscular Dystrophy" (`muscular-dystrophy`), "Myasthenia Gravis" (`myasthenia-gravis`), "ALS" (`als`), "Polio/Post-Polio" (`polio-post-polio`), "Radiculopathy" (`radiculopathy`).
    *   Includes SEO optimizations (`react-helmet`).
    *   Content is currently hardcoded within components. Added "Inflammatory Myopathies", "Muscular Dystrophy", "Myasthenia Gravis", "ALS", "Polio/Post-Polio", and "Radiculopathy" posts to index.
*   **UI Components:** Base UI components (`shadcn/ui`) and custom application components (`src/components`) are functional.
*   **Accessibility Statement Page (`/הצהרת-נגישות`):**
    *   Page component created (`src/pages/AccessibilityStatement.tsx`).
    *   Route added (`src/App.tsx`).
    *   Link added to footers (`Index.tsx`, `Blog.tsx`, `BlogPost.tsx`).
    *   Styling refined using specific Tailwind classes for improved readability.
    *   Image banner implemented using single composite image (`/images/הצהרת נגישות.jpg`) via `write_to_file` after `replace_in_file` issues.
*   **About Us Page (`/about-us`):**
    *   Page component created (`src/pages/AboutUs.tsx`).
    *   Image banner added using `/images/about-us-banner.jpg`.
    *   Redundant image removed from main content area.
    *   Route added (`src/App.tsx`).
*   **Terms & Conditions Page (`/terms-conditions`):**
    *   Page component created (`src/pages/TermsConditions.tsx`).
    *   Route added (`src/App.tsx`).
*   **Footer:**
    *   Refactored into reusable `src/components/Footer.tsx` component.
    *   Updated layout to remove logo section and center links/copyright text as per user image.
    *   Updated links (Accessibility, About Us, Terms).
    *   Replaced duplicated footer code in all page components with `<Footer />`.
    *   Updated background color from `bg-gray-900` to `bg-medblue-dark` for consistency with header and project palette.

## 2. What's Left to Build / In Progress
*   **Contact Form Submission:** Implemented webhook submission logic in `ContactForm.tsx`. Form data (name, phone, email, details) is sent via POST request as JSON to the specified Make.com webhook URL. Includes loading state, success/error toast notifications, and form reset on success.
*   **Blog Content Management:** Currently hardcoded. Future enhancement might involve a CMS or API integration for easier content updates.
*   **Footer Links:** Placeholder links for "מדיניות פרטיות" and "צור קשר" still point to `#`. These need actual pages or updated links.
*   **Testing:** No automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) are apparent in the file structure.

## 3. Current Status
*   **Memory Bank:** Initial setup completed. Core files created and updated.
*   **Accessibility Page:** Created, styled, and banner implemented.
*   **About Us Page:** Created, banner added, content refined.
*   **Terms & Conditions Page:** Created.
*   **Footer:** Refactored, layout updated to centered links/copyright (no logo), color scheme corrected. Task completed.
*   **Blog Pages:** Styling and readability improved. Added mid-content banner to all posts. Added new "Inflammatory Myopathies", "Muscular Dystrophy", "Myasthenia Gravis", "ALS", "Polio/Post-Polio", and "Radiculopathy" posts to both `BlogPost.tsx` and `Blog.tsx`. Task completed.
*   **Contact Form:** Submission logic implemented via webhook. Task completed.
*   **Performance:** Code-splitting implemented for page routes. Task completed.
*   **Overall:** The website is functional with the new pages, updated footer layout, improved blog styling including the six new posts (visible on index and individual pages), working contact form submission, and route-based code-splitting. Awaiting build verification and next task.

## 4. Known Issues / Potential Improvements
*   **Footer Duplication:** Resolved.
*   **Footer Color Scheme:** Resolved.
*   **Footer Layout:** Updated to match user image.
*   **Placeholder Footer Links:** Links for "מדיניות פרטיות" and "צור קשר" are placeholders (`#`).
*   **Contact Form Backend:** Submission implemented via Make.com webhook. (No dedicated backend API).
*   **Blog Content Source:** Content is hardcoded.
*   **Testing:** Lack of automated tests.
*   **Build Warning:** Code-splitting implemented to address chunk size warnings; verification via `npm run build` is needed.
